The notebooks and code in this repository are meant to explore and illustrate exponential growth, and the effect of different variables (such as growth rates) on that growth.  Both the information about the virus, as well as the mathematics, or other info could be incorrect, out of date, or otherwise wrong.  **Please refer to public health officials or a medical doctor for accurate information about the virus, as it actually pertains to reality.**
